Project creation options
==============================

Each Divio project is based on a combination of *Platform*, *Type* and *Boilerplate*. You can
select from our optional ready-to-go definitions for a quick start. For example:

* **Platform**: *Python*
* **Type**: *django CMS*
* **Boilerplate**: *HTML5*

Alternatively, you can build your own from scratch.

By default, your project will use Divio's own private Git server. Alternatively you can select a Git provider of your
