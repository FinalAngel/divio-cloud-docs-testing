Using ``docker``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``docker`` command is mostly used to manage Docker processes, and Docker itself. Mostly, you'll never need to use
it, but it can be useful when you need to understand what Docker is doing on your machine, or for certain operations.
See the :ref:`Docker command reference <docker-reference>`.
