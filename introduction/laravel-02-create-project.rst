.. _tutorial-flavours-php-set-up:

Create a new PHP/Flavours project
===================================

..  admonition:: Our Flavours implementation is in beta

    Flavours on Divio is currently in a *beta* phase. `Learn more about Flavours <https://www.flavours.dev>`_.

In this section we will create and deploy a new project in the Control Panel using `Laravel <https://laravel.com/>`_, a
popular PHP web application framework. The principles covered by the tutorial will apply to any other development stack.

..  note::

    This tutorial assumes some basic familiarity with PHP. It is intended to introduce the basics of working with
    Divio, using Laravel as an example. **It is not a tutorial for Laravel**.
