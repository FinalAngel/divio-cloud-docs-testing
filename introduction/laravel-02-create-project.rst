    Flavours on Divio is currently in a *beta* phase. `Learn more about Flavours <https://www.flavours.dev>`_.

In this section we will create and deploy a new project in the Control Panel using `Laravel <https://laravel.com/>`_, a
popular PHP web application framework. You don't need to know Laravel or PHP, or have them installed on your system.
The principles covered by the tutorial will apply to any other development stack.
