Tutorial
=========

The tutorial will introduce you to the Divio toolchain, and the complete cycle of project creation, development,
deployment and management.

..  admonition:: Prerequisites

    The tutorial assumes you are comfortable with the command line, and understand the basics of using SSH keys, Git
    and so on.

    **Not a developer?** If you would like a quick overview of the Divio platform features and interface, see our
    short video `Web project management with Divio <https://www.divio.com/demo/watch/?video=management>`_.

The tutorial will take you through a complete cycle of operations as Divio developer using Divio, from setting up a
project locally to deploying your own application on the cloud.
