Tutorials
============

These tutorials are recommended for the new user. We suggest that you follow
them in order.

They will take you through a complete cycle of operations as a Divio Cloud
developer, from setting up a project locally to deploying your own applications
on the Cloud.

These tutorials assume that you are reasonably familiar with using the command
line for development work, and that you know how to use and manage things such
as Git, Pip and SSH keys.

If not, `our tutorial for non-developers
<http://support.divio.com/academy/basic-how-to-build-a-website-and-blog-with-dja
ngo-cms-60-minutes/introduction>`_ will be a better starting point.
